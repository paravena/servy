<h1>Clark's Wildthings Refuge</h1>
<blockquote>
    When we contemplate the whole globe as one great dewdrop, stripped of its
    outer husk, we see it as it truly is - a beautiful and fragile ecosystem. It
    is our responsibility to protect and preserve this precious resource for
    future generations.
